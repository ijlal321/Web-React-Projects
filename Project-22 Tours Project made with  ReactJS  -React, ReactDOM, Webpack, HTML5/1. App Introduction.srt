00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,400
So Industrial will be learning about React.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:09,000
Its hooks, how two minutes deep with hooks will be getting our data from API, as well as we'll learn

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,930
how to manage state.

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,670
And at the end of the tutorial, we'll be deploying it up on the Heroku server.

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,270
So let's take a tour around that app.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,070
So basically, it's a tool to step in this project.

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,800
People can be in different places with their details as well as their pricing, and if they are not

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,590
invested in that particular place, they can remove that from their UI.

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:36,060
And if we will get a new set of leaders, so this is all about the ad that we're making, though it

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,490
may not seem as very much, but believe me, you'll be learning quite helpful concepts and react that

11
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,230
will be helping you in the future applications.
