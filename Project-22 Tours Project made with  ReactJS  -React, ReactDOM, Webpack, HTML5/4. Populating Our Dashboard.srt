1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,460
So now we're moving to India after GSX failed, and let's create a boilerplate over there.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:12,060
So the first thing we will do is call a dashboard component in our app component because app is the

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,760
parent component of dashboard component.

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:19,440
And once we do this now, let's import dashboard into our Abdul GSX.

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,910
So we'll be importing our dashboard into Abdul G6 six.

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,140
And once it's done, we have to define its but.

7
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,200
And that, in this case is the cash to splash dashboard.

8
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:45,130
OK, Sylvia fomented the cold now let's move into our dashboard component and create the boilerplate

9
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:49,810
where you just create a boilerplate with authority code snippets.

10
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:57,010
Now the first thing that we're doing our dashboard is that will be adding certain amount of juice and

11
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:57,340
code.

12
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:02,440
So if you want to add this amount, this code, you have to just copy paste the file that I provided

13
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,580
along with this tutorial.

14
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:09,830
So you'll get this stores, which is a static data, and don't worry, you'll be replacing the API calls.

15
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:18,280
But for timing, we are just using the static data and now that skarlatos component and parcel these

16
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,370
objects and part of the object of two.

17
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,880
So that's important to add component import tool from field slash to.

18
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:39,640
OK, so we have imported our autos company now will very passing data via props and those equals to

19
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,830
dos and don'ts that go on subject.

20
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,620
It's the area of objects that we have.

21
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:52,000
Oh, I have no hit safe and let's move into our tour company then.
