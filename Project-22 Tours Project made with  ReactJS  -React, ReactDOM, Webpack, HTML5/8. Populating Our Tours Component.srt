1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,760
He will import react from the Act module, then will create a clone stores, which is out of function.

2
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:12,170
Then a return call will return a statement.

3
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,470
And this has got a section.

4
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,840
And inside that section, there's going to be a day of class name title.

5
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,280
And in this title will have an extra element of our doors

6
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,510
and a day of class classroom underline.

7
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:47,590
Now we'll go out of this div and create another level of class name list.

8
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,110
And inside this list will be having.

9
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:04,900
So let's just restructure the objects that we are receiving and that the stores will be mapping that

10
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:10,110
there to the object so that each and every element of it can be displayed on a UI.

11
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:17,750
We're just mapping those that map and it will take about two document and then return.

12
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:28,720
And call our tour component, and the function of the store component is to display each and every object

13
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,410
specifically.

14
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,290
So now we have our third component right in front of us.

15
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:41,050
And using the spread of radar will be just transmitting all the data that we have and as you might be

16
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,180
aware about the height and structure of our app.

17
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:52,450
So let's just first important component from the address period slash tour, and it'll be sending our

18
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,260
data to the tour.

19
00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:00,070
And now let's just export before the value tools component.

20
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,810
After this, after this will be heading to our third component to configure it.

21
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,570
So now let's just move to a two component.
