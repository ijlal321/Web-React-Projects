1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,810
So now that our app is completely ready, it's time for deployment.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,000
So where are we going to deploy our app?

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,500
But app on the head?

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:12,270
Ocasek, head of the cloud platform, as a service supporting several programming languages.

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,290
So we are going to deploy it app on this server.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,520
And there is a catch to it will have to actually add up a battery pack.

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,150
So let's just move into how to go.

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,300
It's totally free app, so all you need to do is actually just log in with it and it will give you your

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,330
dashboard as you can see mine.

10
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:38,470
So once you reach on a dashboard, just click on New to create a new app and create a new app.

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,420
After that, you'll have to enter the name of the app.

12
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,040
So let's limit driver's.

13
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:54,010
So let's name it travels, so if we see this name is not available travel, so let's just name it travel

14
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:54,430
list.

15
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,330
App.

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,620
So our travel list app is name is available, so let's just create our app and prior to trading windows,

17
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,040
choose the region nearest to you.

18
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,850
For me, it's here, maybe for you, with my United States.

19
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,570
And if it's your idea and just do it and click on create new app.

20
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,390
So now here is that dashboard.

21
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:26,420
So we're going to deploy our app, so there are three ways in which they actually deploy our app to

22
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,480
adequacy or through up through containing registry that is again, Erghezi.

23
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,100
So they'll be using the GitHub option.

24
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,240
So just move to a GitHub.

25
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,360
Now we need to have our code inside our GitHub repository.

26
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:47,290
The first thing that will do is move into our data repository and let's just go to our guitar.

27
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,010
And we're pushing hard core into this, so for that purpose, let's create a new new repository.

28
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,580
And once you do this.

29
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,780
OK, so the name of my repository is going to be travels.

30
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,300
It can be anything.

31
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,060
There is no restriction on the name, you can actually name it anything.

32
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:11,520
So I'm just naming it travels and it is available, then it is going to a public repository and then

33
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,660
just create a repository.

34
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,840
No one's about the trees created, and I will be pushing out code into this, so if you haven't done

35
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,390
this before, you just follow along with me.

36
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,160
Just get initialized at app.

37
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,900
So just move into your source code and open a terminal.

38
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,060
Not just getting attacked.

39
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,010
We just get in it.

40
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,890
And then hit enter.

41
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,740
So a repository has been initialized.

42
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,440
Now let's move back and see what the next command is, he won't be adding Read me because it is already

43
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,700
available in our app and will make it the first commit.

44
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,280
So just copy this, come on and again, paste it in our.

45
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:09,810
Mean.

46
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,570
And then just hit enter.

47
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:20,180
OK, so we have to just first added, get ad space and a period.

48
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:00,950
So again, it is not OK, you know, the next command is.

49
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,230
Get real adding remote building, the address on which it has to be pushed.

50
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,760
So we just moved back.

51
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,460
Phil Gordon paste the following command.

52
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,470
OK, you have ordered Origin to adapt.

53
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,440
Now we're really pushing code to get.

54
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,630
So then again, pasted and hit into.

55
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,590
No, this is going to push our app into our data repository.

56
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:33,960
There are going to get up and let's just move back and refresh this page.

57
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,580
So if you refresh it.

58
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,340
You'll see your source code here, as well as the red meat already added with it.

59
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:57,110
Now we have a repository right here, so let's just move back into ahead of UCLA and search for all

60
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,460
the repositories that we have.

61
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,380
So we're here, we're having all the repositories, so the name of our repository travels, right?

62
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,140
So just search for travelers.

63
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,390
So here we have a repository, just connectivity.

64
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,520
So no one's connected.

65
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:24,440
Just wait for Clia to pass before deploying and Will automatically applies.

66
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,730
And before we deploy our branch, we need to add a battery pack to it.

67
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,770
So just moving to your settings.

68
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,200
And just scroll down and here have to add a belt back for our React app.

69
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,450
So for this purpose, we will just move.

70
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,100
We very back.

71
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,340
And this is the address of the fact that we're going to copy.

72
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,780
So we'll have to paste this link into our belt back option.

73
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,190
So if you want to search for it manually, do I provided you in the links?

74
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,800
All you have to do is search for a remarkable pack

75
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,690
rat pack edible.

76
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:10,260
And this will take you to the next go to get educated about with the Link Create reactor and this is

77
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,660
your link which you want to page with you.

78
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,310
So just copy this link.

79
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:20,680
And move back into your travel list dashboard and click on Add Back.

80
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,330
And paste your link over here and there and just see if changes.

81
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,030
So now you see a problem saying that you are better power configurations will be used when the app is

82
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:33,840
next deployed.

83
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,420
So now let's just again move back into our deploying.

84
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,510
And now we'll just click on Deploy, everything has been set up.

85
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,940
And I just click on Deploy and it is going to take some time.

86
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,520
And after Nadia, we deployed.

87
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,210
So now that our app has been deployed, let's view Add app, you can see this view button.

88
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,320
Just click on it.

89
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,380
And it will open it up.

90
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,050
OK, so here is a wrap and it has been successfully deployed.

91
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:14,660
Now anyone from around the world can just access it with this utterly.
