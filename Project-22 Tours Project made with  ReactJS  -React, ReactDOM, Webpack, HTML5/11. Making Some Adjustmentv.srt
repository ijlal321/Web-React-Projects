1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,410
So now we'll be adding another component to add up, and this is going to be a loading campaign that

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,170
is going to show up every time an app is being loaded.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:14,010
So for that purpose, inside tools for level making another company known as loading stodgy ASX.

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,970
And once we made, let's just move into that world of.

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,730
Loading, it's not Jesus.

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:28,410
And then as we move into this folder, the first step is to import and react, react from the atmosphere.

7
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,930
So just import, react from react.

8
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,440
And now we'll be creating a functional component concert.

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,730
Concert loading.

10
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,400
That is an out of function.

11
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,590
And that's just exported.

12
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:54,440
Otherwise it would be of no use to us export default and loadings.

13
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:55,890
And.

14
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,390
They put up a written statement in a functional component.

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,030
So it just return.

16
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:12,030
Now it is going to have a dearth of class name loading.

17
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,000
And.

18
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:22,790
No, it has to have a closing or closing tax, so let's just close it.

19
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,380
There.

20
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:32,220
It into now will have an edge forward heading, which is going to have which is going to have the words

21
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,890
loading and no, let's just make it one because it would be way too small.

22
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,920
And let's move to our dashboard and inside our dashboard.

23
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:50,390
Be making another bizarre state, and this is going to be a learning piece of state and city learning

24
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,230
as a setup function.

25
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,650
And initially, we want that loading to be true.

26
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,680
So just use state and the default value of the loading is going to be true and we'll be putting up if

27
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,480
statement after this.

28
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:09,730
So we have a loading as well as sector loading and default status too.

29
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:18,950
So just beneath our use effect and just above in a written statement, just if learning is true, then

30
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,050
we want it to return.

31
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,800
These are fragment.

32
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:35,710
Inside, this will be passing and importing allerdings component armados folder, so learning.

33
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,880
And let's close it.

34
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,790
It must have been at all important.

35
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,690
Yeah, it is now in another statement.

36
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:53,380
And this is going to state that if loading the land, no, it should be left to his department.

37
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:00,240
Let's just move this if those dirt land, you can equal to zero.

38
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,070
If those Deutschland Tripoli votes to zero.

39
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:13,770
Then what we want, what we want is that we will just put up a written statement and inside this and

40
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:20,860
incident will have a man inside this man will put up a different last name, Typekit.

41
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:30,540
And what really is going to hold it is going to hold an edge to that of a reef not always available.

42
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,540
And after this is true, dad will make up a button element.

43
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,070
Of class name between.

44
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:49,500
Median and on click whenever this button is collectively what we want function to refresh our up.

45
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,490
So give it an arrow function, and we'll be calling.

46
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:54,770
Get.

47
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,390
We'll be calling our function.

48
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,360
Which is get.

49
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,080
Those.

50
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:11,780
So what this basically is going to do that if it does, if it happens that we are getting no amount

51
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:16,880
of data from our API, so what we are going to do is it's going to refresh so that we can actually press

52
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:17,690
that data again.

53
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,790
So then just head to.

54
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,990
OK, now there's a bit of more tweaking that we need to do.

55
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:33,920
Just beneath our response or just resetting our loading equals too fast because if an app is going to

56
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:40,880
reach our response to our Jason, that means if I 179, that means we have successfully downloaded the

57
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,750
data and now the sideloading is supposed to return.

58
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,170
False.

59
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,100
So now we have said, we have said, noting, first of all.

60
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,700
Now it's time to save it up, and everything is working fine.

61
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,010
It has been completed successfully.

62
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,530
Now let's just view it up, so to check that whether everything's going fine or not.

63
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,660
So let's move into a browser.

64
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,950
So in our browser, if we see that.

65
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:21,560
Okay, let's just hit refresh to get the piece to see whether it's functioning or not.

66
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:22,610
Okay.

67
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,870
Everybody's been murdered.

68
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,090
Hit refresh.

69
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,290
You will see loading.

70
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,510
OK, we are seeing a loading, but we do not want to be in the extreme that extreme left.

71
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,490
We want to be in the center of the page and it is on extreme left.

72
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:47,370
So let's just move into a indexer ceasefire and make certain changes were there.

73
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:49,680
So now they wait.

74
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,720
So now we'll be targeting.

75
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:53,970
Loading screen.

76
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,920
So there's one left, no, just not loading.

77
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:03,030
And it should be on centre text, eventually a centre and.

78
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,680
Since he had got the chance, let the.

79
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,860
Serious property to a title as well as.

80
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,040
So deselected was indeed an amazing burden should be around for him.

81
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,920
OK, now let's just hit refresh again.

82
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,220
OK, now it's in the center.

83
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,180
So yes, it's really created a loading screen.

84
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,710
Now let's move forward.

85
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,670
Now, if we look at another piece of code, the what was left.

86
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,510
This is going to show up on their own live episode.

87
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:38,120
Our zero talent, but I can say that I just of blew of this device refresh button.

88
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,310
It looks kind of nasty.

89
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:46,270
So to fix this, let's move into our index assess, fail and target.

90
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,580
It's class that is button with.

91
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,840
Give it the background of excel to and five.

92
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,740
And a display of line block.

93
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,800
And after this will give it a.

94
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:07,030
Tithing, 0.2 firearm and 0.5 and a radius of 0.5.

95
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,390
Let's hit save and you are up.

96
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:17,800
So we can see that it is looking different from before, but again, we'll put up some more gold into

97
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,230
our rotate notices so that we can refactor it a bit more.

98
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,470
So will your tax transformation of capitalism to catalyze it all the world?

99
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:28,650
And how do you give it a color up hashtag Tribulus?

100
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,400
Then that's an invite, but a different shade.

101
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,280
And other than this value, add a little spacing of 0.1.

102
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,680
No, it's seven review crap.

103
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,430
So our text has definitely changed, as well as the colour of our text.

104
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,920
Now, because our pointer?

105
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,560
And, OK, now if you're holding with it, we can see your point.

106
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,540
And then a margin of to and a font size of 1.2.

107
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,120
I just hit save and let you add Europe.

108
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,030
So this is the button that we were looking for.

109
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:09,380
It is going to refrigerator, but since I have turned off my network, it is not loading any sort of

110
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:09,610
data.

111
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:09,820
No.
