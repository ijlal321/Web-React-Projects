1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,970
And import react from the Act module.

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,320
And after this, we'll create a concert tour.

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,600
So this is again, another function.

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:20,240
And it should be equal to no written statement and will create an article with the class name single

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,700
too, and as they'll be reflecting a data only title for the United.

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:31,780
And so it is the ideal but app that title is the name of the place service.

7
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:36,970
The definition of the place was, as you may see, that.

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,720
Let me just check here for the error as a player for that particular place.

9
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,600
Will give image source of material that we are getting from our data usage data.

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,950
And let's just close this with our name of Typekit.

11
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:06,960
And regulate Porter and inside this what I should have inside the sport, I will just keep up inside

12
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:17,600
of what I will be having first death of tour information and really at last name off to info and actual

13
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,460
bag of hell.

14
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,410
Just this tag is going to be a.

15
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,720
Name of the place that we're going to visit.

16
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,400
So let's just name it came of trip.

17
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,780
So the.

18
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:44,500
So the consecutive element of style that we have to place in it, and then again, we will be having

19
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,780
an edge for class name of the race.

20
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:57,670
This is the price of that particular tool and it will be adding, let's just for now give it a stagnant

21
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,280
value of nine seven zero dollars.

22
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,160
And next we were having a paragraph element.

23
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:09,820
So this paragraph element is the information of the two that we are going to vote on, and the conjugative

24
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,690
element is that they are getting from a dashboard component.

25
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,910
Now you have actually configured most of the tour two component.

26
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:44,410
Now there's going to be another button class that a user can click to remove that particular face on

27
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,910
the UI.

28
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,670
For example, if someone wants to remove a trip to Big Bend, he might remove it.

29
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,670
If someone wants to remove a trip to Stonehenge, you might remove it.

30
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,160
But for now, it is going to be a stagnant button.

31
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,420
It is not going to do anything, but later on will be adding functionality to it, as you can even see

32
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:07,180
the properties not used in it, so they will be removed using only property in remove function.

33
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,470
And let's explore the further to it up now.

34
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,020
Hit save and let's take a look at that.

35
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,850
OK, so it.
