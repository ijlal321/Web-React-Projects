I know we haven't discussed react yet, but it is helpful to have an up alongside.

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,850
So just turn the command and create React app, followed by the name of your app.

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,990
So now what if I decided to have an uppercase that in my the name of my app?

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,760
What is it is going to do?

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,140
It is going to throw an error to me?

6
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,570
Stating that the name of the app cannot contain a capital letter.

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,950
So to give up a simple limo just travels.

8
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:50,560
Now creating a that takes certain amount of time, so I'll be fast forwarding the rules so that you

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,070
can actually see what is happening in my screen and compare it with yours.

10
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,010
So once the app is created, then we will move forward.
